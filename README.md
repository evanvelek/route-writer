# route-writer
The goal of this program is to take in input of addresses and the number of available drivers and find the best way to split up the routes among the drivers and the best routes for each driver to minimize time spent.


Roles:

Dijkstra's implementation: Lucas/Ryder

Address Grouper: Evan

Distance API: Vibha

Graph implementation: Lucas/Ryder

Front End: Sasha


Not all roles are of equal difficulty -- When a role is completed, if possible, help with other roles. Currently, I believe the API is likely the most time consuming element (just in terms of research).
